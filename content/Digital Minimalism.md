## Why digital minimalism?
I think this topic comes about for people in many different ways. For me it was a realization I had when I was watching my one year old son play but constantly felt the urge to pull out my phone and scroll through digital sugar.

The hooks of the internet and constant notification spam are particularly dangerous for those of us with some type of attention disorder. There are the simple distractions like notifications of course, but even more potent are the algorithmic feeds and how they prey on the hyper-fixation common to the affected peoples. These algorithmic feeds calculate what topics the user is likely to engage with and moves them from one to the other over time in a way that allows for total consumption.
## My goals with digital minimalism
1. Free myself from as many algorithmic feeds as possible
2. Replace these feeds with intentional media consumption
3. Minimize the effects of digital minimalism on my social life as much as possible
