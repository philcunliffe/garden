## Idea
Design a two-phase game which starts with a rummy-like and finishes with turn-based combat using only a standard deck of cards. There could be useful aids like a game mat but the game should be entirely playable with just a standard deck.

I've always loved the idea of a spaceship duel game so I'm going to begin with that as the core idea.

## First shot at rules

### Setup
- Each player gets a 7 card hand
- There is a deck with 3 top cards flipped over in separate piles which all act as discards

## Victory Goals
- Accrue 3-7 duel victories
## Gameplay
### Building Phase (Rummy-like)
1. Each player draws 1 card either from
	1. Top of the deck
	2. Top of one of the discard piles
		1. Immediately replace the taken card with one from the deck before continuing your turn
2. Must end with 7 cards or less by either
	1. Playing a grouping
	2. Discarding onto a discard pile
3. Once a player has placed a grouping into all 4 sections of their ship the other player has 1 more turn then the duel commences

### Ship board
- The ship is made up of 5 systems or groupings
	- Weapons (clubs) * 2
	- Shields (spades)
	- Hull (hearts)
	- Engines (diamonds)
- Each of these areas can hold one grouping which determines it's power

### Groupings
- These are the types of groupings, runs are all suited
	- Pair - 1 points
	- Run of 3 - 2 points
	- Run of 4 - 3 points
	- Run of 5 - 4 points
	- 3 of a kind - 4 points
	- 4 of a kind - 5 points
	- 5 of a kind - 6 points
- If a card in a grouping is in it's designated area, for example the 4 of hearts in the Hull, it's worth a bonus point
- Aces can be played along with any grouping and convert the entire grouping to the aces suit
- Jokers can be used as a substitute for any card but can never get bonus points for a suit

## Battle Phase
- The player with the most points in engines goes first
- Actions
	- Charge shields - +3 to shields up to max
	- Attack - Deal weapons score to other player
