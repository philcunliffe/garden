## 1. Choose a Ship
Your ship type determines the jobs you’ll focus on and comes with special abilities and upgrades that support your chosen style of action. Your ship also defines how you are seen by the factions of the sector, whether as **smugglers**, **bounty hunters**, or **rebels**. The three main ship types are:

- **Cerberus**: Extraction specialists focusing on bounty hunting and retrieval.
- **Stardancer**: Smugglers and blockade runners.
- **Firedrake**: Rebels and criminals fighting the Hegemony.

Once chosen, grab the appropriate ship sheet for that type and proceed with the following steps.

## 2. Choose a Reputation
What reputation has your crew already earned among the factions? This reputation will guide your gameplay and influence XP rewards. Select one from the list:
- **Ambitious**
- **Brutal**
- **Daring**
- **Honorable**
- **Professional**
- **Savvy**
- **Strange**
- **Subtle**

You can also create your own. XP is earned when bolstering this reputation.

## 3. Customize Your Ship
Each ship comes with a set of starting systems (e.g., **Hull**, **Engines**, **Weapons**, **Comms**). You can upgrade two systems from the following categories:
- **Engines**
- **Hull**
- **Comms**
- **Weapons**
  
Alternatively, you can improve **crew quality** instead of a system, which will cost your crew 2 CREd and require a favor from a faction. Depending on your choice, the GM will assign a faction that either helped you or was wronged during the process. You must decide how to respond:
- **Pay them off** (1 CREd, no strings attached).
- **Owe them one** (Promise to return the favor, gaining +1 status).
- **Stiff them** (Take -1 status).

## 4. Choose a Special Ability
Each ship has its own special abilities. Choose one for your crew. If unsure, the first ability on the list is a solid choice for beginners.

## 5. Assign Upgrades
You may select two upgrades for your ship. Options can include:
- **Crew Upgrade**: Choose one (Insight, Resolve, Prowess, or Playbook) and when you train that specific XP during downtime mark 2 XP instead of 1.
- **[[Crew Gear]]**: Start with vehicles or other equipment.
- **[[Ship Gear]]**: General upgrades to your ship
- **[[Ship Modules]]**: Augment the ship physically with things like a Medical bay or a Cloaking device

Once selected, your GM will inform you of two factions impacted by these choices:
- One faction helped, gaining +1 status with your crew.
- One faction was harmed, causing -1 status (unless you resolve it).

## 6. Choose a Favorite Contact
Every ship has a list of NPC contacts. Choose one who is particularly close to your crew. Your GM will then assign:
- One faction that is friendly with this contact, granting +1 status.
- One faction that is unfriendly, giving -1 status.

## 7. Update Your Ship Info
Finally, update your ship’s essential stats:
- **Gambits**: These refresh at the start of every job. (Stardancer and Firedrake start with 2; Cerberus starts with 1).
- **Upkeep**: Add your crew quality to all system qualities, divide by 4, and round down. This is your ship's upkeep cost (usually 2 at the start).
