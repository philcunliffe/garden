“What is the Way?” is a question scientists, mystics, and historians have tackled for centuries. Some things are widely known: It exists. It interacts with gravity and energy. It often changes physics constants where it flows most strongly. Guilds often detect Way-touched places by monitoring these forces and sensing fluxes (this is how they maintain the Hyperspace lane beacons).

Everyone knows of creatures that live partially in (or emerge from) the Way—more commonly found near artifacts and Precursor sites. Mystics agree the Way flows stronger in some places and weaker in others. The biggest of these flows are called Galactic Way lines, which tend to create smaller flows or bend the direction of Way- paths and naturally occurring Way lines in a system.

The Precursors had a deep and involved understanding of the Way. The rest is divided into countless theories, beliefs, and wild guesses. 

Ask any mystic or Guild member and they’ll tell you their own theories. The Way is sacred—or it’s tainted and twists those that use it. It’s generated by a machine at the center of the galaxy—or it flows from other dimensions. Everyone has their own theory, but nobody has hard answers.
