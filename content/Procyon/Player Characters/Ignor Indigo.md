## Backstory
Ignor Indigo was born the first son of a prestigious noble house, destined to inherit wealth, power, and influence. However, from a very young age, Ignor’s interests lay far from the world of politics and nobility. Instead of courtly affairs or family traditions, he was consumed by a passion for mechanics and tinkering. He would spend hours dismantling and rebuilding anything he could get his hands on, whether it was a household machine or a family speeder.

This obsession, while harmless at first, soon became a source of conflict. His father, proud and demanding, saw Ignor’s devotion to machines as a waste of his potential and a disgrace to the family name. Over the years, disappointment grew into resentment, and the tension between father and son became impossible to ignore. Finally, the decision was made—Ignor would be disowned, and the responsibility of continuing the family legacy would pass to his younger brother, Kenn.

With nothing left to tie him to his old life, Ignor took matters into his own hands. On the night of his disinheritance, he stole one of the family’s ships—a sleek vessel he had secretly modified over the years—and disappeared into the stars. Since then, Ignor has roamed from system to system as a wandering mechanic, using his skills to survive and keep his ship in the sky. He’s long left behind the world of noble politics, finding more joy in repairing engines and upgrading ships than he ever could have in a life of luxury. Ignor Indigo is no longer bound by family expectations—he’s finally free to follow his passion, wherever it takes him.
