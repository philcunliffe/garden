## Backstory
7-D was created by the Yaru, the notorious bioengineers of the Makers Guild, as part of their clone-slave workforce. Like all clones, he was designed for a short lifespan, meant to serve and deteriorate after a few years. But something went wrong—or right—during his creation. 7-D was "overcooked," a term used by the Yaru for clones who resist the typical rapid aging and breakdown. Unlike his fellow clones, 7-D didn’t deteriorate. He watched as those around him, his friends and fellow workers, succumbed to their engineered decay time and time again.

For years, 7-D lived as an ordinary clone-slave, performing his duties while silently mourning the inevitable fate of his peers. Each loss fueled his growing resentment toward his creators. The Yaru treated their clones as expendable, but 7-D was different—he was alive, and he wasn't ready to accept their grim fate.

Determined to escape the endless cycle of death and rebirth, 7-D secretly began plotting his way out. When the moment came, his escape was as violent as it was desperate. Breaking free of his captors, he left chaos in his wake and has been on the run ever since, hunted by the Makers Guild for his defiance. Now, 7-D roams the galaxy, a survivor with a fierce will to live and a past stained with the memories of those he couldn’t save.
