## Backstory
Lando Impera grew up as the second son of a prominent noble family, always overshadowed by his elder sibling who was groomed to inherit the family estate and titles. Like many second sons in noble families, Lando was sent into the military—a traditional path meant to instill discipline and bring honor to his lineage.

Though initially resistant, Lando soon showed talent on the battlefield, rising through the ranks with strategic brilliance and charisma. Yet, as he climbed the hierarchy, he became disillusioned. The military, he realized, was more about serving the Hegemony's oppressive power than protecting the weak or fostering justice. Orders to crush civilian uprisings and protect corporate interests left him questioning his role.

Disillusionment turned to quiet rebellion when Lando began secretly feeding information to the Wreckers, a notorious group of saboteurs who undermined the Hegemony’s control. At first, he justified his actions as maintaining balance, but over time, it became clear: he had more in common with them than with his military comrades.

His superiors, suspecting his growing dissent, sent him undercover into the criminal underworld to root out insurgents and smugglers. But Lando found a freedom in the criminal world that was absent in the structured confines of the military. He thrived in the shadows, becoming not just an informant, but a full-fledged criminal. Now, with his noble background behind him, Lando Impera navigates the fringes of the galaxy, working jobs for anyone who can pay and further entrenching himself in a life of rebellion, intrigue, and crime.

He's no longer a soldier of the Hegemony. He's something far more dangerous—a rogue with insider knowledge and a talent for survival in the cutthroat underworld.
