## Recap
The neon lights of Warren’s industrial sector flicker over the rundown façade of the motel—"Paradise." On the second floor, you’re crouched in the dimly lit hallway, tense and ready to kick in Cho’s door. The air is thick with the quiet hum of the city until it’s suddenly shattered by the roar of a hoverbike revving to life in the alley below.

Before anyone can react, **plasma fire rips through the hallway**, burning across the walls in searing arcs. It’s moving toward you, fast, cutting through drywall and filling the space with the sharp scent of scorched metal.

Without missing a beat, **7-D charges forward, kicking open the next door**. The door caves under the force, but the impact isn’t kind to him. He grits his teeth as pain shoots up his leg—he’s hurt, but it’s open.

**Ignor ducks into cover**, raising his blaster to lay down some suppressing fire. His shots flare in the smoke-filled corridor, creating just enough of a distraction to give the others a chance.

**Lando doesn’t waste a second**. He slips through the open door, spotting Cho’s hoverbike revving in the alley below. Lining up his blaster, he takes the shot. The plasma bolt hits true, and the bike careens out of control. **Cho leaps off, hitting the ground hard**, tumbling to the alley floor. He staggers to his feet, limping now, clearly hurt.

**7-D limps to the fire escape**, determined to keep up. He grabs the rusted rails and swings down, but the escape gives way under his weight. He crashes to the ground, the wind knocked out of him, gasping for breath as the chase continues without him.

Lando quickly drops down next to the writhing 7-D without sparing him a glance, and takes off down the alley. In a quick flashback, he remembers where he parked his hoverbike—just around the corner. He jumps on, and the engines roar to life as he barrels down the alley after Cho. The bike weaves effortlessly between dumpsters and debris, and with a sharp swerve, Lando slams into Cho, pinning him against a metal pole. The impact is hard, and something else falls from Cho’s back—a tiny companion, knocked out cold.
