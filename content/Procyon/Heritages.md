### Imperial
Those with **Imperial** heritage hail from Warren or the Core worlds. You were brought up educated in the ways of the Hegemony, whether through Guild vocational education, Cult teachings, or Noble family tutors.

### Spacer
**Spacers** are families that live in space. Ice miners, station mechanics, and most merchants are born, grow old, and die on spaceships—and may view terrestrial ventures with suspicion.

### Colonist
**Colonists** form the backbone of the Hegemony. These are the farmers, miners, and terraformers that live on the borders of planets, dealing with alien beasts and Precursor ruins more often than most.

### Manufactured
**Manufactured** families are created by the Guilds. These could be Yaru clones who’ve escaped from a facility, or Urbots that have avoided routine memory wipes. They often must hide their origin and independence.

### Wanderer
**Wanderers** come from nomadic families that roam the galaxy. They move from planet to planet as opportunities arise, following economic shifts or simply where the Way takes them.
