A new module can be purchased when the crew advances. Doing so, though, requires time in drydock. If this process is too slow for your crew, run a job to acquire a module, or purchase one (cost in cred is three times that current system quality, or 6 cred per box for an auxiliary module or crew/ship gear). Illegal modules require answers about how you’re acquiring them first before installing them aboard your ship.

You cannot have more modules in a ship system than you have quality in that system (although you can have fewer than the system quality). Auxiliary systems are exempt from this (you can have all the auxiliary modules on your ship).
## Auxiliary Modules
- **Cargo Hold**: Provides enough space on the ship to carry a moderate (CREd-earning) shipment. The cargo is visible when the ship is boarded unless special precautions are taken to hide it.
  
- **Crew Quarters**: Private and comfortable sleeping areas, a luxury in space. No need to share space with others—especially the snoring first mate!

- **Afterburners**: Boosts the engines for short bursts of speed by dumping raw fuel into them. Can be used to treat the engines as one higher rating for a roll, though it risks damaging the engines.

- **Cloaking Device**: Masks the ship’s heat and electrical signature, making it hard to detect or identify. This module is highly illegal.

- **Landing Bay**: Equipped with airlocks, bay doors, and takeoff ramps to accommodate shuttles and small fighter craft for both land and space takeoff.

- **Smuggling Compartments**: Similar to a cargo hold, but designed to avoid detection during scans or visual inspection. At hull rating 3+, it includes life support for smuggling people.

- **Gravitic Field Generator**: Generates a large gravitic field between ships, useful for grappling or towing. A temperamental and dangerous Guild prototype that is illegal.

- **Jump Drive**: A specialized engine for activating the Ur gates that connect star systems, allowing ships to travel through hyperspace lanes.

## Hull Modules
- **Shields**: Equipped with particle sinks and electromagnetic deflectors, shields act as armor against ship weapons and energy discharges, fully absorbing blaster fire. This module requires two upgrade slots instead of one.

- **Vault**: A secure storage area for valuables during space travel. Includes programmable locks and access logs, using hull rating when contested.

## Engine Modules
- **Fake Transponder**: Broadcasts a different ship’s signal or simulates a powerful sensor echo to confuse trackers. Can also be used as a beacon remotely.

- **Long-Range Scanner**: Provides various electromagnetic and gravimetric readings, allowing early warning of objects or ships up to a dozen light-minutes away.

- **Power Reserves**: Extra batteries and energy supplies that can power the ship independently for a short time. Acts as armor against power-related mishaps.

## Comms Modules
- **Nexus Link**: Connects the ship to the Hegemonic System Network, allowing real-time messages, news updates, and sensor data access. Insecure and vulnerable to hacking.

- **Quantum Encryptor**: Encrypts the ship's communications and data storage, offering protection against interception and hacking attempts.

## Weapon Modules
- **Particle Cannons**: High-energy weapons designed for capital-class ships. Usually fixed in one direction, and illegal without a license.

- **Coherence Cannon**: A one-shot high-powered cannon, typically used on dreadnoughts. After each shot, it requires extensive repairs or recharging. Extremely illegal.

- **Missiles**: Projectile weapons mounted with drives for propulsion. Also illegal.

- **Grappling Hooks**: Typically used to latch onto asteroids or cargo, this array of nets, lines, and arms can be used to tow or board another vessel. Legal for non-combat purposes.
