* Sha-sihara the Speaker (who trains with her ship’s Mystic) has
been waiting in the Governor’s mansion when she notices a
serving-drone carrying refreshments. She **attunes** to it, stops
it, and turns up the charm in response to its upset whistles and
chirps, asking it to take her through the drone entrance to meet
the Governor.
* Rogan’s crew has smuggled a Guild scientist to some Suneaters
on Indri. They’re about to cash in when the Urbot by the Suneaters
twitches, grabs a gun, and opens fire. “Not so fast!” says Rogan’s
player. “I can sense killing intent by **attuning** to the Way. Flash
back to a few seconds earlier where I frown, look around, and yell
‘Look out!’ before the robot fires.” “Cool, sounds like a 0 stress
flashback since you folks are a bit nervous about this handoff in
the first place. It’s a risky roll, where the risk is you paint yourself
as the first target for that killer Urbot when you yell.”
* Negotiating with an Ashen Knives Pasha, Sha-sihara realizes
she spoke words she didn’t intend to. She disguises her surprise
by sipping on some Shimayan sun wine, and **attunes** to the Way,
looking for the danger. She sees Way-warping around the Pasha’s
ring—he has an artifact that forces both parties to say nothing
but the truth. She studies it, gathering info, and realizes that it
doesn’t prevent omission or false implication. The negotiations
just got interesting. She sets her glass down and continues the
negotiations.
* The crew of the Starbreaker is on the fifth moon of Nightfall,
following a map to an Ur artifact that might sell well on the black
market. A giant pair of doors blocks the way, with no obvious
opening mechanism. U’tu, their Mystic, **attunes** to the Way,
becoming one with the doors. He safely activates the Precursor
mechanism in the doors and opens them for his crew.
* Sha-sihara is stealthily leading her crew onto the Governor’s
grounds for a job, but the Governor’s prized Kyraxxian razor
hounds are roaming the gardens! She steps forward, **attuning**
to them and smiles, putting her command to good use. Because
they’re well-trained, and naturally predatory, she uses the attune
roll effectively as a setup action and commands at a much better
position now that they can understand her.
