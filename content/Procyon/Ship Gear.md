### Holo-Emitters
Used for holo-conferences and flashy displays. The images don’t usually hold up to close scrutiny but can be convincing for a short while. Includes games and vids for entertainment.

### Intruder Alarm
A suite of sensors around the ship, including motion detectors, door codes, and panic buttons. When triggered, alarms and flashing lights activate to signal intruders or unauthorized access.

### Land Rover
An armored, all-terrain vehicle capable of carrying heavy cargo and personnel overland. Comes equipped with a high-powered winch and decorative stickers.

### Power Reserves
Extra batteries and energy supplies that allow the ship to function independently of its engine for a few hours at minimal power or a few minutes at full power. Functions as armor against power-related mishaps.

### Shuttle
A small spacecraft that can ferry a few people from the planet’s surface to orbit. It has limited system capacity (all systems are quality 0 versus real ships). Best stored in a landing bay to protect it from debris or weapons fire.

### Stasis Pods
State-of-the-art pods that provide life support for one critically injured or unconscious individual. They do not prevent dreams but can keep someone alive during long-term travel or until medical aid is available.

### Vault
A secure storage area for valuables during space travel. Equipped with programmable locks for personalized security codes, one-time use codes, and access logs. The vault uses the ship's hull rating when contested in security checks.
