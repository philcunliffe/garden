“Mystic” is a catch-all for members of various groups that espouse particular philosophies about the Way. Many have sacred sites (often near Precursor ruins) and artifacts that members carry or inherit. There are hundreds of mystic groups and their requirements for membership are equally varied. Some only have a handful of adherents, whereas others are so powerful that members are only talked about in hushed tones. The farther from the Core you go, the more brazen they are about showcasing their garb and powers.

Mystics often wander, looking for sites and Ur artifacts for their group. Ones that settle or build shrines often trade wisdom, cleanse houses of Way creatures, and provide guidance to locals. Because of the prevalence of artifacts among Syndicates and the Nobility, those in power often hire a mystic to “handle” such issues their rivals might bring to bear. It’s not unusual for a Syndicate or faction leader to have a mystic at their beck and call.
