The Hegemony takes the stance that [[Precursor]] artifacts and [[Precursor|Ur]] sites are dangerous and should be left to those who will take the burden (and responsibility) from the weary shoulders of the average citizen. The two groups that do this most widely are the Guilds and the Cults.

The Guilds generally don’t deal in mysticism. Their control is related to specific artifacts and technologies derived from them. For example the Engineers control and reprogram [[Urbot]] AI cores, while the [[StarSmiths Guild]] forge jump drives and maintain the gates.

The Hegemonic Cults are approved religious and mystical structures, spread widely through the Hegemony. It’s trendy for Nobles to have a Confessor from one of the approved Cults, and representatives from several advise the Hegemon on spiritual matters. They regulate which mystics are allowed to exist. The Cults wield political power not unlike the Guilds and Nobles, and similarly squabble amongst each other. Ultimately, their power is derived from the Hegemon, who decides which Cults are approved—an authority often used for political gain. The Seekers only became a true Hegemonic Cult because one of their members is the mother of the current Hegemon.

Farther from the Core, Cult power becomes less dominant. [[Xenos]] have mystics of their own. Certain Cults may have strongholds in some systems (with many faithful) but little presence in others.

The [[Church of Stellar Flame]] claims that all people have a holy Light inside them, darkened by exposure to Ur sites and artifacts. They accuse mystics of dimming this Light and have a branch of Inquisitors dedicated to rooting out sources of such corruption. They’re generally seen as zealots, and might have been removed as an official Cult long ago, except that the militant orders within the Church (with their powerful and complex battle armors) have been useful tools for past Hegemons.

Near the Core, one might find the [[Vault Keepers]], who hollow out planets to store artifacts deemed too powerful to be used.

Farther out in the distant sector, one might come across the Mendicants, who once tended to the sick and wounded throughout the Hegemony, but were branded heretics by the [[Church of Stellar Flame]] and purged during the last Hegemon’s ascension. Or perhaps the [[Cult of the Seekers]], who look to find new and unexplored places, open locked gates, and believe with incredible intensity that all places should be visited and explored, and to go to an unknown place is a sacred rite.
