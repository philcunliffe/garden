## Purpose
I watch more Youtube content then any other video content, but lately I've noticed the algorithm aggressively pushing me towards creators I find distasteful. For years I've joked about the "alt-right pipeline" that exists on Youtube (the concept that the algorithm will always lead you to alt-right content). It has been present but usually very easy to avoid. I have found this part of the algorithm to be more aggressive recently which leads me to the fundamental question of this note:

How can I watch Youtube without being on Youtube.com?
## Solutions
Luckily, there are several methods for watching Youtube without actually being on Youtube. Even more lucky are the solutions alignment to my recent interests of [[Home Networking]], [[Self-Hosting]], and [[Open-source Software]]. I'll be attempting to list all the solutions I've found along with pros and cons.

For now I'm choosing to try out [[Tube Archivist]], check out that page for an evaluation.
### [Invidious](https://invidious.io/)
Invidious is a open-source self-hostable service which is essentially your own personal UI for Youtube. There are publicly hosted instances of invidious you can check out [here](https://docs.invidious.io/instances/).
##### Pros
- Has accounts which allows users to have subscriptions
- Integrates with [Sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
- Well supported by the public with things like redirectors and proxy scripts
##### Cons
- Set up is mildly complex
- The UI is minimal to the point that it may effect functionality

### [Tube Archivist](https://github.com/tubearchivist/tubearchivist)
Another self hosted service with the key difference that Tube Archivist downloads the youtube video to your storage. This has advantages and obvious disadvantages.
##### Pros
- Videos cannot be "taken down" from your personal collection
- Has integration with Plex and Jellyfin though I found the Plex one to be buggy
- Browser extension for easy downloading
- Discord server for support
- Easy installation
- Integrates with [Sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
- Keeping the storage size down may encourage better consumption habits
- Could possibly integrate with my #iPod workflow to use it for videos on the go
##### Cons
- Requires an immense amount of hard drive space depending on how many videos you want to keep
- Auto-delete functionality only works for played videos
- Cannot prevent automatic deletion of a single video, only a whole channel

### Libretube
TK but primary disadvantage is that it requires a Piped account to actually work well

### Grayjay
TK but primary disadvantage is that it's android only
