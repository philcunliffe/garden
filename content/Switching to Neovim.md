#zettel #nvim 

[[Neovim]] is an extremely extensible terminal code editor which is a form of the popular Vim editor. Not only does it look extremely cool to use but adept users are able to code extremely quickly. This note will document my attempt to adopt NeoVim as my primary code editor.
## Set up
I spun up NeoVim using [NVChad](https://nvchad.com/), which is a premade config that installs several essential plugins like a file tree, terminal, and fuzzy file finder. Either the standard OSX terminal does not work properly with NVChad or I did something wrong but after some searching and switching to [wezTerm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) NeoVim was up and running.

If you're new to Vim or just familiar with the basics I highly recommend trying out the `vimtutor` command to learn the basics.

## Thoughts
For years I have created custom bindings on my keyboards or computers that converted capslock + ijkl into arrow keys as well as capslock + h as "home" and capslock + n as "end" so this is the first thing I sought to do in NVIM. This sped up my adoption and coding speed significantly but I've come to realize it takes away from my ability to use vim-like commands on any machine which is a key advantage of adopting nvim.
