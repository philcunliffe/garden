## Metadata

- Category: #books

## Highlights
- Since the observed brightness of stars goes down inversely with the square of the distance to the star (the light spreads out uniformly over a sphere whose area increases as the square of the distance, and thus since the light is spread out over a bigger sphere, the intensity of the light observed at any point decreases inversely with the area of the sphere), determining the distance to faraway stars has always been the major challenge in astronomy.
