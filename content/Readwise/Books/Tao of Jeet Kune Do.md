## Highlights
- Art reaches its greatest peak when devoid of self-consciousness. Freedom discovers man the moment he loses concern over what impression he is making or about to make. ([Location 186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052FYPJK&location=186))
- In Buddhism, there is no place for using effort. Just be ordinary and nothing special. Eat your food, move your bowels, pass water and when you’re tired go and lie down. The ignorant will laugh at me, but the wise will understand. ([Location 200](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052FYPJK&location=200))
- Eliminate “not clear” thinking and function from your root. ([Location 230](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B0052FYPJK&location=230))
