- Category: #articles
- Summary: Digital gardening is a way to collect and explore ideas that evolve over time, rather than just being organized chronologically like traditional blogs. It encourages a more personal and experimental approach to sharing knowledge, allowing for creativity and unique layouts. This concept has gained popularity as communities seek alternatives to standard web formats, fostering a welcoming space for intimate and public exploration of thoughts.

## Highlights
- They're not following the conventions of the "*personal blog*," as we've come to know it.

- Gardens are organised around **contextual relationships and associative links**; ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9y0s6sje02myqapev3cr81k))
- there is no "final version” on a garden ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01j9y1pajwc8bfd4tzagxvq7fh))
- Think of it as a spectrum. Things we dump into private WhatsApp group chats, DMs, and cavalier Tweet threads are part of our *chaos streams* - a continuous flow of high noise / low signal ideas. On the other end we have highly performative and cultivated artefacts like published books that you prune and tend for years.
