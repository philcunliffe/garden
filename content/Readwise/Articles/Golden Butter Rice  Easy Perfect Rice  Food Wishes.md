## Highlights
- inspired by believe it or not an ancient Indian drink called Golden milk ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwe2c56e0d7jtjs4fadcwq))
- add an entire stick of unsalted butter to a
  pan or pot and we'll let that melt over medium heat ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwgwnzhq4g2282rtmqv3xd))
- as soon as that butter is melted and starts bubbling we will toss in some freshly grated ginger root plus the other star of the show a nice spoon of ground turmeric and then we'll also do a little bit of cayenne for some heat as well as a little bit of brown sugar for a touch of sweet and then we'll finish up with some salt at which point we'll take take a whisk and cook this during
  for exactly 1 minut ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwv57srhrf3b3h8g3kv69v))
- transfer in two cups of basmati rice or another type of white long grain rice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwvpyxhe7p52pf29tk8ep2))
- we will not stop stirring until we're confident every single grain of rice has been completely coated with butter ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwg5da9cea7jc585e695db))
- pour in three cups of cold fresh water and that's because we use two cups of rice and in my opinion the perfect ratio is 1 and 1/2 cups of water for every cup of rice ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwwj01gaf5s2dkv3cgqff5))
- we'll raise our heat to high so we can bring this up to a boil as quickly as possible which by the way is a common mistake for people that don't know how to make rice correctly right they have their heat on way too low at this point and by the time the mixture finally starts to boil the rice is half cooked ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwk8d3qq514e17aec2y2xq))
- yes I said medium low heat even though a lot of recipes say low okay I think we need our flame at least this High to keep the mixture simmering enthusiastically right cooking this on too low of a heat setting is another very common problem ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpwp5n9ha72x85rqkrszdej))
