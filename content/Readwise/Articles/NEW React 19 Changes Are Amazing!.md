- Full Title: NEW React 19 Changes Are Amazing!
- Category: #articles
- Summary: The latest React 19 version brings significant changes, with the introduction of a React compiler being the most prominent. This compiler automates memorization tasks, eliminating the need for certain performance-focused hooks like use memo and use callback. Additionally, React 19 enhances form handling with the use of actions, provides new hooks like use form status and use form state for easier form management, and introduces use optimistic for optimistic updates. The update also stabilizes features like client versus server directives, simplifies metadata management, and enhances suspense functionality to ensure proper loading of styles, links, and scripts. Other improvements include better compatibility with web components, elimination of forward ref usage, and the introduction of the versatile use hook for asynchronous operations and context handling.

## Highlights
- the biggest change is going to be that they're actually adding a compiler to react ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpk8vgfddddr6x7cza21ndb))
- automatically react is going to add its own memorization for things like use memo use callback and the memo function so you never have to use those hooks or functions ever again ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpka621tyt79hxm1a8dqxqr))
- you can create a form and instead of passing an on submit you pass it an action and this action will take in all of your different form data and you can do whatever you want with this action ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpkdhgrb08qg7htv3t7p92s))
- another additional hook that's being added is use optimistic ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpkhfdsrgbgqav5zgn0rfb2))
- want to use web components in react it should be much easier to implement them inside of a react project ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpkrnnfkcwgmdpkg0grenne))
- forward ref is something you are never going to need to use ever again and that's because the ref prop that you normally get by using forward ref is
  automatically going to be passed to every component inside of react so you can just use refs by just passing it along as a second prop ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpkt0915badeqf4csm0yd1a))
- a brand new hook called use just simply use is being added to react and this use hook allows you to do a lot of really cool stuff it allows you to essentially asynchronously load things whether that's going to be asynchronously loading JavaScript files ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpkv8n3gfjc0x6gx3bvchcg))
