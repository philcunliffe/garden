- Summary: The document from Golf Digest reveals a clever aiming strategy used by professional golfers to optimize their shots. This strategy involves visualizing an "ice cream cone" of potential misses for each shot and aiming to position these misses strategically on the course. By focusing on where all their shots would end up rather than just the best shot, players like Justin Thomas and Cameron Smith have been able to improve their game and achieve success on the course. This approach, influenced by Ben Hogan's strategic insights, emphasizes playing the odds and accounting for randomness in golf to maximize performance.
