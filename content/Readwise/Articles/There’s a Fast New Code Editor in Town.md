- Summary: A new code editor named Zed has entered the scene as a fast, open-source alternative to existing options like VS Code. It boasts high performance, leveraging CPU cores and GPU for speed, and integrates AI seamlessly, supporting GitHub Co-Pilot and OpenAI for code conversations and refactoring. While the editor is currently limited to Mac OS, plans are in place to expand to Linux and Windows, catering to a broader user base if a sustainable business model is established. Despite some limitations, Zed presents a promising option for developers seeking a clean, fast, and AI-enhanced coding experience.

## Highlights
- it achieves this performance by leveraging all of your CPU cores along with the GPU using its own GPU framework it works like a video game where it rasterizes the entire window to deliver 120 frames per second ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpx335c45mqqahf5vhgaeea))
- the editor is also integrated with AI out of the box it supports GitHub co-pilot but also allows you to bring in your own open AI key to have conversations about your code right in the editor ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpx4d1pdn7nd1cfkf1tgmpf))
- currently it's not extensible so if there's a feature missing there's not going to be a plugin to help you out they do plan on releasing a plugin API in the future ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hqpx60haggmrt7e2m5mqnxwv))
